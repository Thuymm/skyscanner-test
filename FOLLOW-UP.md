# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

<p>
I didn't use any extra third party libraries. It is enough with the setup to do a implementation of this task.
</p>

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

<p>
First time you need to install the node modules with `npm install`. After that use `npm start` commend to start the application.
</p>
(Default) `npm start`

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

<p>
I would fixed the flexbox css for the UI to exact UI with responsive layout and implement the API call by reading json file.
</p>

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

<p>
Creating reuseable components part is the one the most proud of in this task and give a lot of time to build that component. Whatever the Card UI comes, you can use this component until the data format is not wrong.
</p>

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

<p>
I spent the most time on building the FlightCard component. The backpack UI framework doesn't suppport Gutter and Columns and a lot of struggle to do with flexbox which I am still learning to build the UI component.
</p>

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

<p>
It was great and a bit challenging for me to build the UI things. Anyway it was fun to do.
